## Philosophy

LeanPHP is built on these core principles:

1. **Simplicity First** - The codebase should be easy to understand and maintain
2. **Security by Default** - Security features are built-in, not add-ons
3. **Performance Focused** - Minimal overhead with optimization opportunities
4. **Standards Compliant** - Follows HTTP standards and PHP best practices
5. **Developer Friendly** - Great error messages and debugging support

## Getting Help

- Check the documentation index above for your topic
- Look at the example code in each section
- Review the test files for usage patterns
- The framework is designed to be self-documenting through clear code structure
